## Overview

The Kotlin Timer library offers a powerful and flexible way to manage time in your Android applications. With features like CountdownTimer and Stopwatch, this library utilizes Kotlin Coroutines Flow for efficient and smooth operations. Whether you need to count down to an event or measure elapsed time, this library has you covered.

## Features

- **Countdown Timer**: Easily set a timer that counts down to zero.
- **Stopwatch**: Track elapsed time with precision.
- **Kotlin Coroutines Flow**: Built with modern Kotlin practices for seamless integration.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead, perfect for mobile applications.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API that requires minimal setup.

## Installation

To include the Kotlin Timer library in your project, add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.example:timer-kotlin:1.0.0'
}
```

Make sure to sync your project after adding the dependency.

## Usage

### Countdown Timer

To create a countdown timer, use the following code:

```kotlin
val countdownTimer = CountdownTimer(60000) // 60 seconds
countdownTimer.start { timeLeft ->
    println("Time left: $timeLeft ms")
}
```

### Stopwatch

To use the stopwatch, initialize it like this:

```kotlin
val stopwatch = Stopwatch()
stopwatch.start()

// After some time
val elapsedTime = stopwatch.stop()
println("Elapsed time: $elapsedTime ms")
```

## Examples

### Countdown Timer Example

Here’s a complete example of a countdown timer:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val timer = CountdownTimer(10000) // 10 seconds
    timer.start { timeLeft ->
        println("Seconds left: ${timeLeft / 1000}")
    }
}
```

### Stopwatch Example

Here’s how to use the stopwatch in a simple application:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val stopwatch = Stopwatch()
    stopwatch.start()

    // Simulate some work
    Thread.sleep(5000) // Sleep for 5 seconds

    val elapsedTime = stopwatch.stop()
    println("Total time: ${elapsedTime / 1000} seconds")
}
```
